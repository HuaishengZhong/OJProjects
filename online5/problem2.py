"""
Description: Given a square grid of size n, each cell of which contains integer cost which represents a cost to
traverse through that cell, we need to find a path from top left cell to bottom right cell by which total cost
incurred is minimum. Note : It is assumed that negative cost cycles do not exist in input matrix.


Input: The first line of input will contain number of test cases T. Then T test cases follow . Each test case
contains 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the grid. Next line of
each test contains a single line containing N*N space separated integers depecting cost of respective cell from (0,
0) to (n,n). Constraints:1<=T<=50ï¼Œ1<= n<= 50
